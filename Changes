      - Ability to integrate into event loop
      - Try to avoid using of IO::Socket::IP and HTTP proxy in the tests
      - Bump I::S::S dep to 0.63, earlier version had bug inside new_from_socket()

0.10  Wed Dec 18 23:40:35 NOVT 2013
      - Tests fixed

0.09  Thu Dec 12 16:17:59 NOVT 2013

      - Fix for barewords syntax: connect(SOCK, $addr)
      - Rebless socket to GLOB after IO::Socket::Socks->new_from_socket
